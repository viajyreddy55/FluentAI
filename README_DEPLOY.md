# Deploying FluentAI to the Public

You can deploy your HTML app using any static hosting service. Here are three easy options:

## 1. GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repository and push your project files.
2. In your repo, go to Settings > Pages.
3. Set the source to your main branch and `/` root.
4. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## 2. Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign up.
2. Import your GitHub repo or drag-and-drop your folder.
3. Vercel will auto-deploy and give you a public URL.

## 3. Netlify
1. Go to https://netlify.com and sign up.
2. Drag-and-drop your project folder or connect your GitHub repo.
3. Netlify will deploy and provide a public URL.

## Quick Test (Local)
You can also use [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to preview locally:
```sh
npm install -g serve
serve .
```
